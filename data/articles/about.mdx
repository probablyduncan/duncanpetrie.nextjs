I'm a photographer, writer, and web developer from Milwaukee, based in London.

In 2022, I graduated from Falmouth University in Cornwall with a 1st class degree in [Marine & Natural History Photography](https://www.falmouth.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/marine-natural-history-photography). Ever since, I've been a full time .NET developer, working on passion projects like this website on the side.

In 2019, after one look at the price of Squarespace, I decided to make my own website, from scratch. Every six months, or whenever I'm feeling antsy, I remake it entirely.

I built this iteration ([github](https://github.com)) in the early months of 2023 using Next.JS and MDX. You can explore previous iterations of my website [here](/i/sites).

Much of my art explores the _Yearning,_ a kind of nostalgia, felt at the edges of things, for lives or worlds that don’t or can’t exist. Fleeting details in the landscape—the tail of a whale rising out of the sea, or familiar music from a window passed at night—act like glimpses into little worlds.

These worlds we find in the cracks of our own are implied and imagined, no more real than a bedtime story, and yet they are far more emotionally true, pull far stronger on the strings of our heart, than actual fact. Their potency is their unknowability; reality would only disappoint.

I explore these timeless and littoral worlds extensively in my photobook, _[Lingermyth](/a/myth),_ and my undergraduate dissertation, _[On Yearning](/a/yearn)._
