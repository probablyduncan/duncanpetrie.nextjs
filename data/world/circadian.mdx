Circadian Zandalack was looking forward to the autumntide.

But not for the usual reasons. He wasn't running off to a cottage on the Orchard Coast, or gallivanting away with the sous-chef's wife, or jumping on the slow boat to far Ossea.

No, he wasn't leaving at all. He was going to stay right here, at home, on the lower ground floor of the Hotel Telemet, and he was going to enjoy it.

Everyone always seemed so surprised. What would he do, here, all by himself? What's the point of a doorman, in a hotel with no guests, no staff?

But that was entirely the point. Circadian, frankly, liked to be left alone. He always had, all 73 years of his life. He was good, alone. Good with his thoughts. A lot of people he knew, they couldn't go five minutes without breaking the silence. A lot of people were afraid to be alone.

And anyway, he'd never felt the pull of that tide. Betty loved to talk about the thrill of Octobering, the hell-with-it rush out the door and the smell of the wind when your back is to home. Betty, of course, who was just as old as he was, who spent the winter in Gentrey. Not even a day down the coast. Hardly a hell-with-it place to go. The water, there, just as cold as here.

He stretched his white gloves up his wrists and opened the door of the Hotel Telemet. Another family leaving. They thanked him and tumbled out onto the street, all their cases and children and things. He watched them corral it all across the plaza, like shepherds. One more empty room in Raggamud. One step closer.

Betty always said the anticipation was the best part. Living the last days of your normal life, knowing soon you'd be far, far away, gone with the tide, on some distant, warmer shore.

There was a different sort of anticipation, though. The whole of the Hill would soon be quiet. Everybody would soon be gone.

"They're doing a show, tonight," said Betty from behind the concierge's desk.

Circadian nodded. They did a show every night, on the makeshift stage next to the fountain.

"You do know it's the last one of the year," she continued. "Supposed to be a goodbye sort of thing. It has a name. Farewell to the summer, something like that. Sending, sendoff, oh, sendoff to the summer. That's it. A sendoff to the summer. Everyone's going."

Everyone always went.

"I heard they're bringing a twelve piece band. And the Raggamud Company's doing _Wash of the Mighty._ That new one, what's his name, is playing the beaver. What's his name?"

"Tim?"

"Oh, I don't know. But he's playing the beaver. And the band, of course, will play the woodsman's chorus." She was silent. "I do love a show," she said, after some thought.

An elderly woman came down the stairs and Circadian opened the door for her. A trapezoid of golden light swung across the lobby walls as he pulled the door closed again.

"Timothy Wig, that's it," said Betty. "Little Tim Wig."

"When are you leaving?"

"Oh, so soon," she gushed. "Two days more. I can barely wait. Tomorrow I'll be packing, and in two days I'll be on the boat, and in three I'll be in little far Gentrey, flowers in my hair."

He couldn't wait.

It wasn't that he didn't like her, or the rest of them. They had their quirks, of course. It was nice to have a break.

"You're still not going anywhere?" she said.

"You ask me that every year."

"Well, I don't know. Maybe you're doing something different." She thought for a second. "Are you going to be sad when everyone leaves?"

"Oh, well, maybe." No.

"Well, maybe sometime you'll try it. It's all about spontaneity, you know, Octobering." Betty, who went to the same place every winter.

"Maybe."

Nobody had arrived today, and nobody would. The only times Circadian opened the door were to let people out. He spent most of the day looking out at the plaza. Raggamud was a busy neighbourhood. In the summer, at least, it was packed to the brim. The restaurants, the gardens, the canals and squares carved into the hill. Everyone wanted to be in Raggamud in the summer.

He was glad, at least, he had a job with a view, not stuck behind Betty's desk or deep in the kitchens. The grand front doors of the hotel were mostly glass, high and blueish and slightly warped, and they threw warm lays of afternoon light upon the dark floor of the lobby.

When it was clear there was nothing left to do, Betty went to find the restaurant folk, who it seemed had already 




The Hotel Telemet was grand, optimistic. Its walls were made of polished, sun-orange, thick-cut stone, and its windows were as tall as glass can blow. The curtains could be used as sails. It was solid, right-angled, with a steep, boxy, pitched roof that held three more stories of windows, a _you thought it was over_ sort of stubbornness, and above that a flat top with chimneys like pitchfork tines against the sky.

It was the kind of building, the kind of testament to human progress, that gets built at the turns of centuries. 

The particular century of the Hotel Telemet, however, was not one of the recent ones.

But as the years piled up they weighed heavy on the hotel, pulling, straining it, warping its floorboards and bending its ancient pipes.
